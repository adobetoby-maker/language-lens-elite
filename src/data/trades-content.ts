We can do a straight replacement with a 50-gallon Bradford White — that's what I keep on the truck, made in the USA, good unit. Installed it'll run $1,100 to $1,200 depending on what I find when I pull the old one — sometimes the flex connectors are corroded and need replacing, sometimes the flue pipe needs an adjustment.
