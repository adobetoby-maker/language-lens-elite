/**

 * captures activity from any game tab without each game knowing about
 * the daily-challenge layer.
 *
 * Implementation: keep a ref of the last-seen sum. On any change that
 * means INCREASE, fire `recordCompletion()` exactly once. The reducer
 * itself handles "already completed today" and only bumps streak on the
 * first completion of a new day.
